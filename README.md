# microsoftcodefundo

This was a project done under a competition organised by Microsoft. The idea was to make a web app that will help to find number of 
people trapped in a particular place during a natural calamity. 

It will take adhar card,pincode and city as input. It will count the total number of person trapped in that city and will help us to allot 
funds, security members etc.

The framework used here is django.
